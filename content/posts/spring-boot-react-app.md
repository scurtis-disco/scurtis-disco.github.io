## Spring Boot + React

I have started a passion project looking to create a simple application with a React frontend and Spring Boot backend. The
goal is to have a working basic time-tracking application when I am finished and to have a project I can use for talking points
when it's inevitably interview time again.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/scurtis-disco/spring-react-demo).

I would like to add on additional infrastructure pieces as well, like Docker and Kubernetes integration to demonstrate my
abilities in that area, but my focus is local-first with an eye towards the future.

This is a WIP as of June 26th, 2024 and I will continue to update this post as I make progress.
